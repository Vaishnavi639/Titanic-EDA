# Titanic Dataset EDA 

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, which is one of the most well-known datasets for data science and machine learning. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in the data and draw insights that might have affected the survival rates of the passengers.

## Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic ship, including their age, sex, passenger class, and whether they survived the shipwreck. This project performs a detailed analysis to understand the factors that contributed to the survival of passengers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found on Kaggle or other open data sources. The dataset includes various features such as:

* PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
* Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* Name: Passenger's name
* Sex: Passenger's gender
* Age: Passenger's age
* SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
* Ticket: Ticket number
* Fare: Fare paid for the ticket
* Cabin: Cabin number
* Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

  ## Libraries Used

  
      import pandas as pd
      import numpy as np
      import seaborn as sns
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      import warnings
      from scipy.stats import ttest_ind, chi2_contingency
      warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')


## Data Cleaning
Basic data cleaning steps were performed, including:

* Handling missing values
* Converting data types where necessary
* Removing unnecessary columns

### Key functions used:

* shape()
* describe()

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**1. Basic Information**
* Checked the shape and summary statistics of the data.
* Analyzed the distribution of numerical and categorical features.
  
**2. Visualizations**
* Countplot of Gender: Visualized the distribution of male and female passengers.
* Countplot of Passenger Class: Analyzed the distribution of passengers across different classes.
* Countplot of Embarked: Analyzed the distribution according to Embarked.
* Violin Plot of Age, Sex, and Survival: Explored the distribution of ages by gender and survival status.
* Line Chart: Showed trends over continuous variables.
* Histogram (Histplot): Examined the frequency distribution of continuous variables.
* Heatmap: Visualized the correlation matrix to understand relationships between features.

**3. Correlation Analysis**
* Identified correlations between features using a heatmap.
  
**4. Statistical Tests**
* T-Test: Performed t-tests to compare means between groups (e.g., survival by gender).
* Chi-Square Test: Tested for independence between categorical variables (e.g., survival by passenger class).

## Conclusion:

The analysis provided insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. For example, gender, age, and passenger class were significant factors.
